# ProteinFamiliyClassification
Protein Familiy Classification based on CNN and LSTM

The code follows the structures from CIFAR-10 tensorflow example 

LSTMProteinSequenceMain.py and CNNProteinSequenceMain.py are the main files to start the training process

DataRead  is the preprocessor file which creates the numpy files to start the training
